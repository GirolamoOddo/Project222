### WHAT WAS DONE?
In this work, following a systematic approach, a Nonlinear-Autoregressive (NARX) type model was developed in order to predict the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic, with the following performance in Test:
*R^2 0.90*
*MSE 9.47 e-3*.

A method for the application of the obtained model has also been proposed in the report.

### WHAT'S IN THE REPOSITORY?

• "Traffic Data Analysis for Modelling and Prediction of Traffic Scenario.pdf"

This is an extended description of the work performed and the results obtained.

• "Code_NARXnet.m" This is the MATLAB file where it is possible to inspect what has been done. 

• "NN-IN.xlsx" This is the Inputs set used.

• "NN-TARG.csv" This is the Target set used.

• The file "Untitled.slx" and "MyNeuralNetworkFunction.m" are the Simulink block and MATLAB code of the NARX network respectively.

### HOW TO USE IT?
1. Download the files:
"NN-IN.xlsx", "NN-TARG.csv", "Code_NARXnet.m".
2. Save the files in the same folder.
3. Open "Code_NARXnet.m" with MATLAB ( with the " Deep Learning Toolbox" installed ).
4. Run and train the network!
